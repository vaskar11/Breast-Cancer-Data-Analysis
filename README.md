# Breast Cancer Data Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a breast cancer dataset. The primary goal is to investigate the dataset and extract meaningful insights using various data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset includes features related to tumor characteristics, which help in classifying whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
## Features
1. Data Loading & Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and its structure is explored with basic statistical summaries and null value checks.
2. Data Visualization: Graphical representations like distribution plots and correlation heatmaps are generated to understand the relationships between the features.
3. Correlation Analysis: A heatmap visualizes correlations between numerical features to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
## Libraries Used
1. Pandas: Data loading and manipulation
2. Matplotlib: Data visualization
3. Seaborn: Advanced data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset contains features related to breast cancer diagnoses, including numerical measurements that describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images.

1. Diagnosis: The target variable indicating whether the tumor is Malignant (M) or Benign (B).
2. Features: Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more.

## Visualizations
1. Diagnosis Distribution: A count plot showing the distribution of benign and malignant diagnoses.
2. Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap showing the correlations between numerical features in the dataset.

## Future Enhancements
1. Add predictive modeling to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
2. Improve data preprocessing and feature selection.
